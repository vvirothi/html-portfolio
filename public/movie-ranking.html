<h1>2024 Pongal Movie Ranking</h1>
<h2>The Following is my movie ranking for 2024 Pongal</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Hanu-Man</h3>
<p>This is an Indian superheero film from the Prasanth Varma Cinematic Universe(PVCU).
    This is 4/5 film with great references of Lord Hanuman,
    riveting BG Score, great performances, decent story, and a good villian.
    This a very good start a superhero cinematic unieverse.
    This even had great glimpse for the next installment.</p>
<h3>Guntur Kaaram</h3>
<p>This is a film that came with a lot of hype before its release.
    The film is the third collaboration of Super Star Mahesh Babu and Director Trivikram.
    This duo made two classic films in the past, in which one was a decent hit and other which didn't do well
    at the box-office. But these films gained cult following over the years. But this film lacks the magic
    of Trivikram's dialogue combined with a repeatedly told story and bad songs, music.
    This film can be rated 2.5/5 for the performance of Mahesh Babu.

<h3>Saindhav</h3>
<p>This film is 75th film of Victory Venkatesh. This is a decent action flick from the director Dr. Sailesh Kolanu.
    His previous films the H.I.T. franchise were so successful and created a interest for Saindhav in the public.
    But the film lacked strong story and which feels like a copy of the John Wick. The film has decent fights which 
    doesn't offer anything new. Overall the film can be rated 2.5/5.
